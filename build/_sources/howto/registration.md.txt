# Student Github Registration

We have a new student registration system for recording student's Github account. This system includes a disposable email address that will help with the Github account verification process when the student doesn't have an email address.


To access the student registration system, click on "Account Setup" in the left side menu, or go directly to: [https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/howto/account_registration.html](https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/howto/account_registration.html)

Send students to that link to register their account. At the bottom of the page
is the Instructors Interface, where you can manage the class codes and registrations.

## Instructors Interface

[https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class](https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class)

For most classes, before students register, you must create a class code. ( You
will rarely re-use a class code. ) You will usually just enter your name and the
location name, then hit submit to create a generated class code, then hit submit
again to save it.

That is: for the first submit, **don't enter a class code**, just your name and
the location name. The form will generate a class code. Then, hit submit again
to save it.

You should have a new class code for every new class, even at the same location.
The interface will only show the last two days of classes to students, so they
won't see old class codes. If you need to see all of the class codes, use this URL:

[https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class?show_all](https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class?show_all)

### Class Lists

Click on the class code to see the list of students who have registered, for instance: 

[https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class?class_code=SMOT-VW](https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class?class_code=SMOT-VW)

### Authentication Email Group

The students disposable email addresss will go to a google group, which you can join here:

[Authentication Email Group](https://groups.google.com/a/jointheleague.org/g/students)


## Student Interface

 [https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/howto/account_registration.html](https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/howto/account_registration.html)

The registration system now has two parts: students enter their name and email
first, then the Github account. Have them select the class code you recently
created.  On the next page is their account name -- a two word phrase -- and a
disposable email address. In this example its:
students+recursing_goldstine@jointheleague.org

If the student doesn't have a useful email address, use this one. You will get
the Github confirmation code to the google group "students@jointheleague.org"
which I have added you to, so you should see the emails in your email client.If you aren't in the group, you should still be able to see the [emails in the Google Groups interface.](https://groups.google.com/a/jointheleague.org/g/students), or visit that link to ask to join the group. 

You will get a lot of them, and they will all look the same, except for the from
address, which will have the funny word ( 'recursing_goldstine' ) in it. Match
those up, and give the kid the code.


## Test the Registration System

If you visit the registration page, you might not find any locations in the pull down
list, because the system is set up to only show class-codes created in the last two days. If you want to test the system, use this URL get get all of the class codes:

   [https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class?show_all](https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class?show_all)

Then, select the class code `CSCS-GS Cpt Stubins MS Pacific Princess`, the test
class code
